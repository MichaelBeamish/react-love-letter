          Will your love letter woo the Princess and win her heart? Utilize the
          characters in the castle to secretly carry your message to the
        </h6>
        <h6>
          Princess, earning her affection. Love Letter is a game of risk,
          deduction, and luck. Designed by Seiji Kanai, the game features simple
          rules that create dynamic and fun player interactions. Players attempt
          to deliver their love letter into the Princess’s hands while keeping
          other players’ letters away. Powerful cards lead to early gains, but
          make you a target. Rely on weaker cards for too long and your letter
          may be tossed in the fire!
